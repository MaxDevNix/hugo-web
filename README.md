# My Website

This website is for everyone that uses or wants to use GNU/Linux, but has some error or a bug that prevents them from fully enjoying it.
It is mainly a repository of bugs and errors and how to fix them for my personal use, so I don't have to spend a lot of time searching on how to fix that one bug when I reset/change my computer, but I might from time to time talk about other things too.
