# My Website

This website is for everyone that uses or wants to use GNU/Linux, but has some
error or a bug that prevents them from fully enjoying it. It is mainly a
repository of bugs and errors and how to fix them for my personal use, so I
don't have to spend a lot of time searching on how to fix that one bug, but I
might from time to time talk about other things too.
