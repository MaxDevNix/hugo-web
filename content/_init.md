Hello, I am Max.
I love Linux, and i made this site as a guide for people who use Linux and have problems with some applications/utilities not working.
This website was made with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io), and currently does not have ads nor sponsored content.
If I would want to monetize this website, i would do so with:
1. Sponsorships, that I would choose, and they would be on the side/bottom of the website and there would be only images and static text, not videos nor tracking links, for conserving bandwidth.
2. Donations, using only privacy-preserving platforms/methods.
