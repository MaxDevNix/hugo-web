Hello, I am Max.
I love Linux, and I made this site as a guide for people who
use Linux and have problems with some applications/utilities not working. This
website was made with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io), and currently does not have
ads nor sponsored content.
<!-- If I would want to monetize this website, i would do -->
<!-- so with: -->

<!-- If, in the future, I decide that I will monetize this website, I will do so with: -->
<!-- 1. Sponsorships, that I would choose, and they would be on the side/bottom of -->
<!--    the website and there would be only images, normal links and static text, not videos nor -->
<!--    tracking links, for conserving bandwidth, and preserving privacy. -->
<!-- 2. Donations, using only privacy-preserving platforms/methods. -->
<!-- and i will add it to this website's privacy policy -->
<!-- 3. Subscriptions, using the same services as for donations, -->
<!-- and the content will be later (1 month later) released for people without subscription -->
<!--end-->
