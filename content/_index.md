Hello, I am Max.
I love Linux, and I made this site as a guide for people who
use or want to use Linux and have problems with some applications/utilities not working. This
website was made with [HUGO SSG](https://gohugo.io), and currently does not have
ads nor sponsored content.

<!-- ## Website Monetization: -->
<!-- 1. Donations: -->
<!--    - Privacy-preserving platforms -->
<!--    - [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/) -->
<!-- 2. Sponsorships: -->
<!--    - Chosen after extensively trying out their product without any special treatment (reduced/no cost, premium features/features not available for standard users/features not *yet* available for all users). -->
<!--    - Will not respond to emails and other messages trying to get me to sponsor their product/service, for security reasons. -->
<!--    - Sponsorship segment will not be in article, it will always be on the bottom of the article. -->
<!--    - If I will make an article about sponsored content, it will be clearly labeled and tagged as such -->
<!-- 3. Ads: -->
<!--    - Contextual, NOT TARGETED/BEHAVIORAL Ads -->
<!--    - Position on the bottom of the article -->
<!--    - Only text, images and normal links. (No videos nor tracking links, for preserving bandwidth and privacy) -->

<!-- If I would want to monetize this website, i would do -->
<!-- so with: -->

<!-- If, in the future, I decide that I will monetize this website, I will do so with: -->
<!-- 1. Sponsorships, that I would choose, and they would be on the side/bottom of -->
<!--    the website and there would be only images, normal links and static text, not videos nor -->
<!--    tracking links, for conserving bandwidth, and preserving privacy. -->
<!-- 2. Donations, using only privacy-preserving platforms/methods. -->
<!-- and i will add it to this website's privacy policy -->
<!-- 3. Subscriptions, using the same services as for donations, -->
<!-- and the content will be later (1 month later) released for people without subscription -->
<!--end-->
