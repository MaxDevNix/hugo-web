[Zellij](https://zellij.dev) is a relatively new terminal multiplexer, that is designed to be
easy for beginners to understand and use, <!--but is a little graphically bloated by default.-->
while still being very configurable
and full of features more experienced users will appreciate.

## Installation
One of the things that make zellij interesting, is the ability to try it in your shell before installing it.
## Features
It has panes, tabs and sessions (like TMUX), and has native session resurrection capabilities.
## Configuration
The configuration is stored in $XDG_CONF_HOME/zellij/config.kdl with language [KDL](https://kdl.dev).
